# Language: English only

In this project (Autokong), **everything must be in English**:

- **User interface (UI)**: All labels, buttons, messages, placeholders, page titles, nav links, and any user-facing text must be in English.
- **Code**: Comments, docstrings, variable and function names, commit messages, and in-repo documentation should be in English.
- **Error messages** shown to the user must be in English.

**When editing the codebase**: Correct any existing French (or other non-English) strings in the UI and in code you touch. Do not introduce new French or other languages.
